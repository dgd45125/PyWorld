PyWorld is implemented in the Python 3 Jupyter Notebook PyWorld.ipyn.

The only dependency is pygame which can be installed via the Anaconda 
Prompt with the command 'pip install pygame'.

Keep the game asset folders in the same directory as PyWorld.ipyn 
and the asset loads should be fine as they are relative path based.

To run the game, simply run all cells.

There is code in the Game Loop section towards the bottom
where you can set the game to loop on keypress.
